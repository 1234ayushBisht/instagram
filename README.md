# Instagram
Hello there , I am Tuhsar This is my full stack build of Instagram clone using a very popular stack called `MERN` Stack , if you don't know about  `MERN` you can check about it on different websites.

It basically stands for:
M - MongoDB (A simple NoSQL database) || https://www.mongodb.com/
E - Express.js (A JavaScript Framework for building web apps) || https://expressjs.com/
R - React.js (A frontend javascript library used for making highly scaleable web apps) || https://reactjs.org/
N - Nodejs (It is runtime enviroment of javascript built on chromes v8 engine) || https://nodejs.org/

This app also uses Google Firebase which is a stack of backend provided by google it is very easy to use and make complex app simply by firebase . It gives us authentication , live database, hosting and stroage. In this project I've used firebase just for storing images.  

Thanks for Reading.
